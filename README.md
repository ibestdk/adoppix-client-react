## Prerequisites
This section will give you some information about what tools you will need.

### Node.js
To install and use Oftadeh React, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed to your computer. We won't get into too much detail about Node.js as it's out of the scope of this documentation. Also you won't need to actually use Node.js, it's only required for the development process.

## Installation

<br />
Download and install at least LTS or the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) from its web site.

**B.Installing Oftadeh React**
<br />
Open your favorite console application (Terminal, Command Prompt etc.), navigate into your work folder, run the following command and wait for it to finish:
<br />

`npm install`

<br />
This command will install all the required Node.js modules into the node_modules directory inside your work folder.

<br />
And now, you are ready to run the Oftadeh React for the first time.

### Development
While still in your work folder, run the following command in the console application:
<br />

`npm run dev`

<br />
And that's it. create-react-app will take care everything and start the Oftadeh React.
